# Model Radar ðŸŽ¯

A framework for aspect-based evaluation of time series forecasting models based on Nixtla's ecosystem.

## Overview

Model Radar introduces a novel aspect-based forecasting evaluation approach that goes beyond traditional aggregate metrics. Our framework enables:
- Fine-grained performance analysis across different forecasting aspects
- Better understanding of model behavior in varying conditions
- More informed model selection based on specific use case requirements

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

TBD
