## Overview

Model Radar introduces a novel aspect-based forecasting evaluation approach that goes beyond traditional aggregate metrics. Our framework enables:
- Fine-grained performance analysis across different forecasting aspects
- Better understanding of model behavior in varying conditions
- More informed model selection based on specific use case requirements

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Check the `notebooks` folder for usage examples and tutorials.


### Prerequisites
