## Overview

Model Radar introduces a novel aspect-based forecasting evaluation approach that goes beyond traditional aggregate metrics. Our framework enables:
- Fine-grained performance analysis across different forecasting aspects
- Better understanding of model behavior in varying conditions
- More informed model selection based on specific use case requirements

## üöÄ Getting Started

Check the `notebooks` folder for usage examples and tutorials.

Check **[ModelRadar-Experiments](https://github.com/vcerqueira/experiments-modelradar)** repository for a thorough
application of ModelRadar.

## Installation

You can install modelradar using pip:

```bash
pip install modelradar
```

### [Optional] Installation from source

To install modelradar from source, clone the repository and run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vcerqueira/modelradar
pip install -e modelradar
```

### Prerequisites

Required dependencies:
```
utilsforecast==0.2.11
numpy==1.26.4
plotnine==0.14.5
```

### Examples

Besides the examples in the `notebooks` folder, here's some outputs you can get from *modelradar*:

- Spider chart with overview on several dimensions:
